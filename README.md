## Begin

We started our work with help of our teacher Oleg Farenyuk. Firstly our Car was like a die monster without any functions. Mr. Oleg bought for us few drivers to work with it: the [first](http://grauonline.de/wordpress/?page_id=3122) and the [second](https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/32950460565.html?spm=a2g0o.detail.1000014.33.280374eaN0gGtG&gps-id=pcDetailBottomMoreOtherSeller&scm=1007.13338.128125.0&scm_id=1007.13338.128125.0&scm-url=1007.13338.128125.0&pvid=e700e67a-c0ac-406b-9729-c6caa390c35d). First one is up to 36V, but it is *cheep Chinees* drivers, so it was exploded. But for Voltage less then 25V it is very good driver for Brushless DC motors.
Now we are working with second one. After first trial it didn\`t expload so we are going to continue working with it.
## First try
As I have mentioned, our first trie was on the first driver, from 12V. here is the result.
