# Hell Machine

#### Project of Morhunenko Mykola ([Myralllka](https://github.com/Myralllka)) and Yuriy Pasichnyk ([Fenix](https://github.com/Fenix-125)) :ant: :wave:
---

  This project aims to be a final course project in Principles of Computer Organization at [Computer Science Program](http://cs.ucu.edu.ua/en/) of [Ukrainian Catholic Univercity](https://ucu.edu.ua/en/). As curator and mentor of our project, we have got our lector of this discipline - Mr. Oleg Farenyuk.

## Short prehistory
This project started even earlier. Our predecessors started to work on this project at [SoftServe](https://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/), but the process stack at first steps, so the University decided to break down this workflow and work on their own on this project at the campus. Now our team is working on it as our course project.

## Achievements
- PWM usage (serco, step motors)
- Driver usage ([first](http://grauonline.de/wordpress/?page_id=3122), [second](https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/32950460565.html?spm=a2g0o.detail.1000014.33.280374eaN0gGtG&gps-id=pcDetailBottomMoreOtherSeller&scm=1007.13338.128125.0&scm_id=1007.13338.128125.0&scm-url=1007.13338.128125.0&pvid=e700e67a-c0ac-406b-9729-c6caa390c35d))

## Documentation for the Car

### How is it looks like:
It looks pretty close to the new Tesla track :) without any taste in "front-end" but with strong possibilities in "back-end."
![]()

### What is inside:

<!-- #### Motors & Drivers:
There are two types of motors inside: four Brushless DC motors inside wheels and two DC motors for turning the front and back will-pairs independently. Motors inside wheels are just simple BLDC from the hoverboard.<br>
And [here](http://www.handsontec.com/dataspecs/L298N%20Motor%20Driver.pdf) is the datasheet for the driver used to rotate the motor.
